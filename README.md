# Deepworld Master Config

This collection of configuration files provided Deepworld's raw game logic data, which was in turn interpreted by the [Game Server](https://github.com/bytebin/deepworld-gameserver).

This readme will provide more information very soon.

## Items (config-items.yml)

The item config provides the most substantial game logic, detailing the appearance and behavior of every block/item in the game.
