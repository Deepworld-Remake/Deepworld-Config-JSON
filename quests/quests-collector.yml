    accept: "How can I help?"
    begin: "It looks like we just need a sprocket and a widget to fix this up. If you don't have them handy, well, I hate to send you into danger, but I do hear the world of Cravenfell has a stash of mechanical parts..."

If you could find an Orator figurine and procure a marble and bloodstone Orator statue, we'd be in business!"
